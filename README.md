# How to play the game:
Run Game.java

# How game works:
Player1 starts by choosing 2 cards, if the cards are not same, the turn will go to player2.
The color will change depending on which players turn it is.
If cards are the same, player1/player2 can continue and will be granted 1 point.
The game is finished when all the cards are gone and the winner will be the player with most points.

# Warning:
Play slow, don't click more than two cards within a second because the game can bugg out and don't click the same button/image as well.

Restart button = restart the game.
Exit button = exit application.
